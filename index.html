         <h3>You didn’t sign up for this when you boarded the train. You were just suppose to pass through this speck of a town, this glorified, desolate hole in the desert. But you’re stuck here now and you’re so thirsty. There’s something very, very wrong with the water in this town, and, well, someone’s got to get to the bottom of this, and it looks like it’s you.

            <h2>Setting</h2>
            <p>The town of Parch. Think vaguely 1900-1920ish south western US style desert mining town. There’s telegraphs and trains and radio and cars, but a whole hell of a lot more of that sort of thing in the cities than out here. I am however, not an expert in the time or place so I’m playing so fast and loose with history that it it’s more a fantasy world with the aesthetics and tech of the time. Is there magic? Well, there’s something out there in the desert that’s doing things that shouldn’t be possible, but beyond that, if there’s magic it’s difficult and most people don’t believe in it.
            </p>
          <p>Content warnings:  cannibalism, drowning, mines/caves, animal death (no pets!), violence, natural disasters, body horror. If we’re talking AO3 archive warnings then no sexual violence but yes graphic violence and maybe major character death.

            <h2>System</h2>
           <p>I’m reskinning (changing the setting but keeping the mechanics) of a one page game called <a href="https://gshowitt.itch.io/the-beast">The Beast</a> by Grant Howitt and Chris Taylor. (It’s pay what you want at the link, if you wanna take a look!) This is one of my favorite games and it’s perfect for short horror games. Character creation is simple, it’s quick to learn, rewards players for getting to the bottom of mysteries, and is unforgiving about the consequences of your actions. (and you get to use all the fun shapes of dice!)  I’ve played a longer running campaign with this for a few years now and everyone I’ve played it with has loved it. I still have to rewrite a copy with new flavor text for this game, but I’ll send it to the discord for this game asap.
